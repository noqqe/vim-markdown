# Markdown for Vim

This is a fork. I forked [gabrielelana/vim-markdown](
gabrielelana/vim-markdown) because it has a nice syntax highlightning. But
does so many other stuff that I dont need and dont use. Its real bloated
und full of fancy features that really slowed down my vim.

I will start with a repo cleanup. In the future I may adjust the syntax
highlight a little.
